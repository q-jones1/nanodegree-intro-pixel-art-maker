## Introduction

This code runs an interactive web game app called **Pixel Art Maker**. The original [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter) was created by Udacity for a course project assessment.  The objective of this project from the student perspective, was to write further code, to fulfil the additional Udacity requirements listed at the website link, in the [Background](#background) section.
Only the `design.js` file should need to be edited to achieve the project requirements.

## App specifics

When this project is complete, a player of the game should be able to create a canvas of any size, choose a colour using the colour picker and click on the canvas's table cells to set their colour. When the player has completed the pixel art shape that they wish to make. The next player should then be able to reset the canvas to a new required size and start the same process again, for the next piece of pixel art desired.
Features will be added via the issue log until the project is complete.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure:
1. That your device is connected to the internet, as some styling is retrieved from there.

2. That you have an up to date version installed _(date of writing 06-02-19)_ of any modern web browser for your device e.g. such as _Chrome, Firefox, Safari._
3. That you have extracted all the files in the .zip or from the github repository, into a single folder on your device.
4. Then just open the `index.html` file.

## Background
